                            2017 MIT Sloan Analytics Conference
                          </h3>
                        <h4 class="post-subtitle">
                            Ryan Burke - Class of 2018
                          </h4>
                        <p>Last weekend, I attended the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference in Boston. It brought students and professionals from across the country to attend talks on the use of analytics primarily in the big four North American professional
                            sports leagues but also in soccer, golf and even chess. Over the course of two days, it had a variety of panels and workshops on everything from advanced football analytics with NBC broadcaster Chris Collinsworth to the future
                            of the NBA with commissioner Adam Silver and Nate Silver, editor in chief of Five Thirty Eight. It was a great experience to learn about how analytics are used to give professional sports teams a competitive advantage, network
                            with some of the leaders in the field and even meet a few NFL players.</p>
                        <p>One of most enticing workshops was Optimization Formulation, given by Sloan Professor Tauhid Zaman. Last summer he made a profit of nearly $70,000 on Draftkings daily fantasy baseball contests, while knowing nearly nothing about
                            professional baseball. These contests have top-heavy payout structures, where the winner can win tens of thousands of dollars, while more than 75% entries make no money. By building high variance lineups, he was able to occasionally
                            win thousands of dollars in a single contest. Over the course of the summer Zaman won four times, including one with a payoff of $50,000. He uploaded his code so that anyone can use his approach to win at daily fantasy baseball.
                            In the future teams in all many professional sports could use an optimization approach to build their team. After all, fantasy contests are modeled after a team’s challenge to build the best team with a limited amount of resources.</p>
                        <p>One of Friday’s featured panels was Silver Asks Silver, where Nate Silver and Adam Silver discussed the future of the NBA. Adam Silver noted that one reason for the rapid growth of analytics in the NBA has come from a younger,
                            more tech-savvy generation of owners including Mark Cuban, who owns the Dallas Mavericks. Another topic was the strength of dynasties in the NBA. Teams with a small group of star players can consistently put themselves at the
                            top of the league. Adam Silver conceded that this was inherent to the structure of the game and that it would be difficult to change this in the near future. Nate Silver suggested that the NBA could remove the spending limit
                            on one player. For example, a team could spend $80 million out of their total budget of $100 million to get LeBron James and surround him with average players. This could hurt the team atmosphere however by manufacturing such
                            a large disparity. This panel didn’t give me a ton of career ideas, but it was definitely a cool chance to hear well-known experts discuss the game.</p>
                        <p>On Saturday former NFL players David Anderson and Owen Daniels presented on the use of next generation statistics in professional football. David Anderson has worked with Second Spectrum, a Los Angeles-based sports analytics company.
                            This session was unique because it featured speakers who had experience in the huddle. They argued that the use of data football has lagged behind other leagues, because every player contributes to the result of each play.
                            In baseball its use is more apparent because mainly the batter and pitcher are responsible. From their experience on the field, they also broke down all the rapid decisions that a football player must make just before the snap.
                            Daniels and Anderson said that in the future the challenge will be to find data that coaches and players can use to gain an advantage on the field and, more importantly, persuade them that this is the case.</p>
                        <p>In addition to several panels about the use of analytics in sports, the conference was an excellent opportunity to discuss careers in the field and to network with some of the leaders in the industry. I talked to private companies
                            such as ESPN and Pro Football Focus as well as professional football and baseball teams about the positions they offer. ESPN was focused on how statistics could be used to entertain fans, while Pro Football Focus uses next
                            generation stats to grade players. Professional sports teams are more competitive, because player analysts have to identify future stars that other teams miss. Baseball analytics departments are very well-established, while
                            their football counterparts are often run by one person and commonly greeted with skepticism from the coaches.</p>
                        <p>The sports analytics industry will likely shape the future of professional sports as games are increasingly quantified. Its an exciting new field fit for anyone with a passion for sports and data science. Anyone considering a career
                            in it should check out the main website for this conference, which uploaded a lot of its content from over the weekend.</p>
