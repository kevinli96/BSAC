                              <b>TLDR</b>: Is Peyton Manning a regular season quarterback? We tested this by
                              comparing Manning's average Passer Rating in the playoffs against Manning's
                              average Passer Rating against playoff teams in the regular season.
                              Performing a simple difference-in-means test, we found no significant
                              drop-off in Manning's play against similar-level opponents in the
                              postseason. We then used the same metric to compare Manning to several
                              other quarterbacks (including Brady, Favre, Brees).

                              Despite being arguably the most prolific quarterback of all time, Manning

                              with detractors pointing to his lack of playoff success, only having won
                              two Super Bowl rings.

                              games against teams which made the playoffs that year. We then performed a
                              difference in means test between Peyton Manning's passer rating against
                              playoff teams in the regular season and Manning's passer rating in the

                              At first glance, the results seem to clearly support the notion that
                              Manning cracks under the pressure of the playoffs. However, as noted above
                              this was expected due to the superior defenses of playoff teams. Thus we
                              ran the analysis again with a smaller pool of regular season games: those
                              against teams that ended up making the playoffs that season.

                              After filtering for regular season games against playoff teams, there is
                              actually only a one point difference between Manning's regular season and
                              playoff averages, suggesting that he is not a regular season quarterback.

                              To test whether or not this difference, though small, could be significant
                              (i.e. still possibly indicative of a difference in performance), we
                              performed a difference of means test with the null hypothesis that Manning
                              does not perform significantly worse in the playoffs than in the regular
                              season. To perform the difference in means test, we make the following
                              assumptions:

                                      We assume the variance of Manning's Passer Rating is constant
                                      between playoff games and regular season games. This is not
                                      conclusive looking at the data (Manning's variance in passer rating
                                      is 701 and 956 for regular season and postseason games,
                                      respectively), but the difference in means test is relatively
                                      robust against violations of this rule so it's not a terribly
                                      massive assumption to make.

                              As shown by the table, there is a range of performance increase/decrease in
                              the postseason among this group of quarterbacks. However, since none of the
                              p-values are below the 0.05 threshold we cannot conclusively say that any
                              of the above quarterbacks performed statistically significantly
                              better/worse in the playoffs than in the regular season.

                              We can see that Manning is right in the middle of the pack; by our
                              measures, some of his peers experience a greater drop off in performance
                              than him while others manage to elevate their level of play in the crucible
                              of the playoffs. While this analysis only addresses one of many variables,
                              it does offer an interesting lens on the question of the greatest
                              quarterback of the era.

                              There were several limitations to our analysis - first, passer rating is
                              not necessarily reflective of how well a quarterback played. Second, while
                              most of the games in our analysis were independent to each other (or at
                              least it doesn't seem egregious to say they're independent), there are
                              times when Manning plays a team twice in a season, and those games are not
                              independent. While this violates the independence assumption of the
                              difference in means test, we understand that a perfect study in this
                              regard is difficult to come by (since we're testing on past data). Since
                              the independence assumptions is not violated often, we chose to move
                              forward with our analysis and share our findings.

                              The analysis conducted above shows that Manning does not perform
                              significantly worse in the postseason, nor does he fall far behind the
                              majority of his peers in his postseason / regular season passer rating
                              differential. Thus, based solely on the results of this analysis, we cannot
                              endorse a reputation of Regular Season Quarterback for Peyton Manning.
                              Though he may not have the ring count of some of the other greats of the
                              sport, there is no doubt that Manning has earned his place as one of the
                              greatest quarterbacks the league has ever seen.
