                    <a

                    deal, the Cleveland Browns acquired the maligned Brock Osweiler from the
                    Texans, and received a 2018 second round pick for their troubles.
                </p>
                <p class = "no-indent">
                    From an asset perspective, the Browns traded $15 million in cap space (per
                    <a href="http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/denver-broncos/brock-osweiler-9867/">
                        Spotrac
                    </a>
                    ) for a player and a second round draft pick. While trading liquid assets
                    (cap space) for draft picks is nothing new in the NBA, this was one of the
                    first instances of it happening in the NFL. The Browns, with their new,
                    analytics-driven braintrust, received praise for their ingenuity.
                </p>
                <p class = "no-indent">
                    Yet, was the Browns trade a good one? Considering the Browns eventually cut
                    Osweiler, the Browns essentially traded 15 million dollars for a second
                    round pick ‚Äì was this too high a price to pay?
                </p>
                <p class = "no-indent">
                    What would be a fair price? One million? Five million? Is it possible to
                    calculate a ‚Äòfair value‚Äô, in terms of cap space, for a draft pick?
                </p>
                <p class = "no-indent">
                    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                </p>
                <p class = "no-indent">
                    Back in 2005, a Canadian blogger named Kyle MacDonald took a humble red
                    paperclip, and over a series of fourteen swaps, ended up with a two-story
                    house.
                </p>
                <p class = "no-indent">
                    An NFL General Manager plays a barterer. The General Manager takes a
                    boatload of cash (however much the salary cap is), and must make exchanges
                    where hopefully, each exchange increases the overall value of the assets
                    under the team‚Äôs control.
                </p>
                <p class = "no-indent">
                    Indeed, <em>value</em> is the key word ‚Äì when acquiring a player, General
                    Managers are also acquiring their contracts. <em>Value </em>is why we often
                    see great players flipped for chump change ‚Äì for instance, in 2014, when
                    the Patriots traded Pro Bowl guard Logan Mankins for a fourth round pick
                    and Tim Wright, a backup tight end. The biggest return the Patriots
                    received in this trade was unspoken: the freed salary space from dumping
                    Mankins‚Äô big contract.
                </p>
                <p class = "no-indent">
                    With this in mind, we can model the NFL has having three primary assets:
                    cash (cap space), players, and draft picks. An NFL General Manager playing
                    professional barterer is necessarily concerned with the following
                    questions:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>How much is a given player worth in cap space?</li>
                <li>
                    <strong>How much is a given draft pick worth in cap space?</strong>
                </li>
                </ol>
                <p class = "no-indent">
                    The second question is of much more interest to me. Valuing draft picks
                    feels like a much more tricky proposition than valuing players. Some draft
                    picks make the team, others do not. Some draft picks pan out, others do
                    not. Draft picks can‚Äôt contribute immediately ‚Äì so in trading for a draft
                    pick, you‚Äôre trading present value (and / or cap space liquidity) for a
                    future value.
                </p>
                <p class = "no-indent">
                    The inherent difficulties in valuing draft picks can make it easy for
                    biases to impact decision-making. Ample previous analytics work on the NFL
                    draft suggests general managers tend to over-value top draft picks, with
                    one explanation being that general managers are tempted to play the lottery
                    and establish a reputation as ‚Äògeniuses‚Äô. Biases can also cause us to
                    undervalue draft picks; how many times after a team trades away a draft
                    pick, have you heard the justification, ‚Äúthe draft is nothing more than a
                    crapshoot?‚Äù
                </p>
                <p class = "no-indent">
                    So, in this project, I sought to establish an ‚Äòobjective‚Äô (by this I mean
                    clearly and hopefully intelligently defined, not ‚Äòabsolutely correct‚Äô üòâ)
                    measure of a draft pick‚Äôs worth in terms of salary cap space ‚Äì in other
                    words, answer the question, ‚ÄúIs a second round pick worth $15 million?‚Äù
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>Methodology</h4>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The intuition behind this project is simple, breaking down into the
                    following steps:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>We use historical AV data to determine how much a draft pick
                        contributes, on average, over the first four years of the rookie contract.</li>
                    <li>We devise a ‚Äòfair salary‚Äô metric which converts AV contribution to how
                        much the player deserves to be paid. We can use this to compute a ‚Äòfair
                        salary‚Äô for a given draft pick.</li>
                    <li>We compare the draft pick‚Äôs fair salary with their actual salary (which
                        is relatively fixed due to changes in the CBA in 2011). The difference is
                        the <strong><em>surplus</em></strong>, which we use to value a draft pick.</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="no-indent">
                    This is a good segue into the assumptions our model makes:
                </p>
                <ol>
                <li><p class="no-indent">The value of a draft pick is equal to its    <strong>absolute surplus</strong>, defined as (fair salary) ‚Äì (actual
                    salary). For instance, if the first overall pick deserves a contract worth
                    $40 million dollars over 4 years, but you're paying them $30 million, then
                    the first overall pick's absolute surplus (value) is $10 million dollars
                    (over 4 years).</p>
                <p class="no-indent">
                    An argument could be made that valuation should be instead percentage
                    return ([fair value ‚Äì actual value]/ actual value)- so in the previous
                    example, the percentage return is 1/3. However, recall that only a small
                    portion of a team's salary cap is spent on draft picks each year, and any
                    money not spent on draft picks can be imagined as offering 0% return above
                    fair value in free agency (see assumption 2 below).
                </p>
                <p class="no-indent">
                    For instance, the Indianapolis Colts are currently spending roughly $16
                    million on drafted players on rookie contracts, or about 10.3% of their
                    total spending (and not much more if we included undrafted rookie free
                    agents on rookie contracts).
                </p>
                <p class="no-indent">
                    To put it another way, I‚Äôd rather spend $20 million on rookie contracts for
                    $30 million in value ($10 million surplus), than spend $10 million on
                    rookie contracts for $18 million in value ($8 million surplus) ‚Äì because
                    the unspent money in both cases will have $0 surplus!<em></em>
                </p></li>
                <li>
                <p class="no-indent">Any 'purchase' via free agency returns market value. In other words,
                    there is no surplus on free agent contracts; an important implication of
                    this is that <strong>no team has an edge in free agency. </strong>This is
                    based on the notion that free agency resembles an open market, so we can
                    assume that every contract is 'fair' (no maximum contract 'caps' like in
                    the NBA). This, of course, is not true in practice necessarily (i.e.
                    hometown discounts, occasional bargains / fleeces) but serves well in
                    simplifying our model.
                </p>
                <p class="no-indent">
                    Another important implication of this assumption is that a draft‚Äôs value
                    lasts only as long as the drafted players are on rookie contracts, as
                    afterwards, the players in those draft are no longer playing for a
                    discount. So after five years, a good or bad draft class no longer has an
                    effect on how good a team is. One recent example where this implication
                    appears to hold weight is the modern-day Seahawks ‚Äì the Seahawks had
                    legendary drafts from 2010-2012, and fielded great teams in 2013-2014.
                    After the players began signing their second deals, the Seahawks have
                    fallen off a bit (but are still quite good). This also means that in
                    modern-era NFL, dynasties aren‚Äôt built through the draft, as the advantage
                    of a strong draft lasts just five years at most.
                </p>
                </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="no-indent">
                    <h4>Part One: Fair Salary Metric</h4>
                </p>
                <p class="no-indent">
                    As noted in the second step of the methodology, we created a ‚Äòfair salary‚Äô
                    metric based on Approximate Value (AV) scores. AV is a metric developed by
                    ‚ÄãPro Football Reference which serves as a proxy for the performance of a
                    player over the course of a season. We use AV because it is objective,
                    comparable across positions (which simplifies the analysis), and because it
                    is rather well-known (it is a common proxy for player performance in other
                    analytics projects). Read more
                    <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/index37a8.html">
                        here
                    </a>
                    .
                </p>
                <p class="no-indent">
                    We used Python‚Äôs Beautiful Soup library to scrape AV data (from Pro
                    Football Reference) and salary data (from Spotrac) from 1994 (beginning of
                    salary cap era) to 2016, and stored it in a SQL database.
                </p>
                <p class="no-indent">
                    We used R to process this data, and calculated the fair AV value for each
                    player as follows, starting with the following assumptions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        AV contribution is linear. I.e. a player whose AV is 8 in a given year is
                        worth twice as much as a player whose AV is 4 in a given year.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        A player with 0 AV is worth $0

                    Using these three assumptions, and inputting the salary cap for every year
                    from 1994 to 2016 (ranging from 34.6 million in 1994 to 155.27 million in
                    2016), we were able to calculate the fair salary for each player in that

                <li>
                    Let SC = total combined salary cap across all 32 teams (167 million times

                <li>
                    Matt Ryan, the player with the highest AV in 2016 (also the league MVP),
                    had a fair salary of $16.13 million in 2016.

                    The most overpaid player (using ‚Äòcap hit‚Äô as salary metric), in total
                    dollars (not in percentage of salary cap) between 1994 and 2016 was Tony
                    Romo in 2016, whose fair salary was 0, but whose cap hit was over 20
                    million

                    Dak Prescott, whose fair salary was 12.3 million, and whose cap hit was
                    546,000.

                <p class="no-indent">
                    Using a merged dataset containing annual AV data for each player (scraped
                    from Pro Football Reference) and draft position for each player (also
                    scraped from Pro Football Reference), we calculated the average AV per year
                    by pick number. The data includes drafted players from 1994 to 2016 (1994
                    was the start of the salary cap era, though I suppose we could have gone
                    back further, since we are looking purely at pick performance here).

                <p class="no-indent">
                    We now have a function representing the expected AV contributions for each
                    pick number, and want to estimate a fair salary for each pick number as a
                    result.
                </p>
                <p class="no-indent">
                    Our AV-to-salary converter (mentioned) in Part One required three
                    parameters: SC (the total combined salary cap across all 32 teams), N (the
                    total number of players who can be on an NFL roster), and AVTotal (the
                    summed AV of the top N NFL players in a given season).

                <p class="no-indent">
                    The important point here is that the fair salary of a draft pick depends on
                    the salary cap that season! And we don‚Äôt have the salary cap numbers for
                the next four seasons. We make a few assumptions    <strong>for estimating the fair salary of a 2017 NFL Draft pick:</strong>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The salary cap stays the same over the next four years ‚Äì $167,000,000.
                        So, SC = 167 million times 32.</li>
                    <li>The NFL roster size stays at 53 and the number of teams stays at 32. So
                        N = 53 times 32.</li>
                    <li>The total AV in all of the next four years is approximated by the
                        average total AV over the last five years (2012 - 2016), which comes out to
                        6559.</li>

                <p class="no-indent">
                    Assumptions #1 and #3 will almost certainly not be true. For assumption #1,
                    knowing that the salary cap will likely increase, we can circle back later
                    and note that our fair salary assumptions are probably conservative. For
                    assumption #3, this value stays relatively constant over the years, so we
                    are fairly confident any differences will be marginal. Our results come

                    <strong>Results and Discussion</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="no-indent">
                    In trading for Brock Osweiler this past Spring, the Browns essentially
                    traded $15 million dollars for a second round draft pick. According to our
                    model, an average second round draft pick provides just ~$8 million dollars
                    in surplus, over all four years of the career.
                </p>
                <p class="no-indent">
                    Let‚Äôs go back to our bartering model. Imagine the assets of an NFL team
                    (players, unused cap space, draft picks) as a big mountain of gold. In a
                    fair transaction (i.e. free agency contract), an NFL team gives up a lump
                    of gold for an equal-sized lump of gold, not increasing or decreasing their
                    overall asset base.
                </p>
                <p class="no-indent">
                    With an average second round pick, an NFL has the opportunity to hand over
                    a lump of gold worth $5.5 million (roughly the average salary over four
                    years for second round pick) and receive in return a lump worth $13.5
                    million. Thus the asset base grows by $8 million. A good trade, for any
                    barterer!
                </p>
                <p class="no-indent">
                    In order to make this transaction though, the Browns gave up $15 million in
                    assets. This means the Browns in essence removed $15 million from their
                    asset mountain, and only received $8 million in return.
                </p>
                <p class="no-indent">
                    So, does that mean the Browns made a bad trade? Not necessarily ‚Äì one
                    explanation is that the Browns wanted to give up present value (they will
                    eat the $15 million dollars this year only, when they don‚Äôt realistically
                    have a shot at winning the Super Bowl) for future value (the surplus is
                    spread over the next four years). In addition, there are intangible
                    considerations - perhaps the Browns wanted more youth in the locker room.
                </p>
                <p class= "no-indent">
                    Also keep in mind, as mentioned, that we assumed the salary cap stays
                    constant in our analysis. If the cap increases as it has been (7-8%
                    annually over the past three years), we can roughly estimate the surplus as
                    being between $8 and $10 million ($10 million assumes that the cap is equal
                    to 1.08^3 all four years, so it is an upper bound).

                    Other interesting findings:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Our results confirm the idea that draft picks tend to be underpaid.</li>
                    <li>High first round picks tend to be overpaid, and under the bartering
                    model, the top six picks in the draft, if made, actually expect to provide    <em>negative</em> surplus. In other words, our model is saying teams
                        picking in the top six should actually pass on their pick (remember, each
                        draft pick is actually an option)!</li>
                    <li>The most underpaid pick (with the highest surplus) is pick number 33, at
                        the top of the second round. As a General Manager, this also means that
                        trading down in the first round is generally a great strategy.</li>
                    <li>The draft is meant in some ways to instill parity in the NFL ‚Äì the better
                        the team, the worse the pick. If the NFL really wants to institute parity,
                        it should consider reducing the salaries of high first round picks further
                        ‚Äì as of now, good teams have the advantage in the first round, as late
                        first round picks grow the ‚Äògold mountain‚Äô more than early first round
                        picks!</li>
                </ul>
                <p class= "no-indent">
                    It‚Äôs easy to fall in the trap of equating high first round picks with
                    superstars like Khalil Mack and Aaron Donald, who massively outperform
                    their rookie contracts. But for every one of those players, there‚Äôs a Greg
                    Robinson or Blake Bortles, who massively underperform their contracts. For
                    General Managers who believe that they are only capable of selecting Khalil
                    Mack‚Äôs and Aaron Donald‚Äôs, these results may mean nil ‚Äì but the data does
                    seem to suggest on average, the high first round pick will not live up to
                    their rookie contract.

                    <li>The fifth year option for first round picks is not factored into the
                        valuation. For first round picks, teams get a ‚Äòoption‚Äô to add an additional
                        fifth year to the player‚Äôs contract, usually at a more expensive salary
                        than the previous four years. For players selected in the first round of
                        the 2014 NFL draft, 23 of the 32 fifth year options were picked up. Thus,
                        we can expect first round picks to be worth slightly more than what our
                        model suggests. Quantifying this would be a worthy next step.</li>
                <li>
                    As aforementioned, another flaw in our model is that we did not account
                    for possible increases in salary cap. The salary cap has increased
                    substantially over the past 23 years, and it is reasonable to expect it to
                    continue to increase. Accounting for this would increase the ‚Äòfair salary‚Äô
                    for the draft picks, and further increase the ‚Äòworth‚Äô of each draft pick.
                    This means that our current estimates for pick worth are almost certainly
                    conservative.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We estimated fair salary by assuming a linear relationship between AV and
                    salary. We lacked a strong basis in making this assumption, and it‚Äôs worth
                    testing to see if it‚Äôs real or not. A better option might just be to use
                market data ‚Äì see the part about Brian Burke‚Äôs project in the    <em>Important Notes </em>section below.

                <li>
                    Finally, it is important to note that Approximate Value is just as its
                    name indicates, an ‚Äòapproximate‚Äô value of a player‚Äôs contribution. Creating
                    a better metric could be a sizeable undertaking but would potentially
                    improve results.

                <p class= "no-indent">
                    A final caveat to note is that these draft pick valuations are only valid
                    for future, unknown draft picks. During the actual draft, these picks
                    should be instead valued based the players available at each selection
                    (which, of course, is not known until usually a few picks before).

                        completed by Brian Burke of Advanced Football Analytics in January
                        2016. Burke‚Äôs project also uses AV as a measure of performance and
                        salary cap ‚Äòsurplus‚Äô as a measure of NFL Draft pick value. I borrow
                        Burke‚Äôs ‚Äòsurplus‚Äô term in my writeup ‚Äì the concept seems useful enough
                        to warrant a custom term. In terms of differences between my project
                        and Burke‚Äôs, I calculate projected draft pick performance a bit
                        differently (focusing on first four years of contract) and ‚Äòfair
                        salary‚Äô differently as well (Burke used market data -what a player with
                        a given AV is typically paid - while I calculated fair salary based on
                        a linear model between AV and salary).

                        Burke mentions in his writeup, produced a landmark paper in 2005
                        valuing NFL draft picks using a ‚Äòsurplus model‚Äô ‚Äì given that it was a
                        ‚Äòlandmark‚Äô paper, I assume that they were the first to use the
